# Wordle Date Select

An extension that lets the user choose the current date for
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). For some reason, this
only works consistently when devtools is open.

# Notes

- This breaks the way Wordle saves state in a playing session.
  Progress does not persist across reloading.
- This will not increment the date automatically.
